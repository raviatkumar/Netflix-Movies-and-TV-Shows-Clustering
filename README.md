## Introduction:

With more than 83 million subscribers and presence in more than 190 countries, Netflix is the most popular Internet television network in the world. Its users watch more than 125 million hours of TV and movie content daily, including original series, documentaries, and feature films. On almost any screen that is linked to the Internet, members can watch as much as they want, whenever and wherever. Without interruptions or obligations, members can play, pause, and resume watching at any time.

## Problem statement

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flexible which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

## Summary and Conclusion:

In this project, we tackled a text clustering issue where we had to categorize Netflix shows into specific clusters such that the shows within a cluster are similar to one another and the shows in different clusters are dissimilar to one another.

Once our dataset is loaded, and then we search for duplicates and missing values. No duplicate values were discovered, and any missing values were used to fill them in. In our dataset, the director column contains the most missing entries, followed by cast, country, and date_added. The string "unknown" is used to fill missing values in the director and country columns, "no cast" is used fill in the cast column, and the mode value is used to fill missing values in the rating column. the records that had null entries in the "date_added" column were deleted.

31% of Netflix's content is television shows, while 69% of it is movie show, demonstrating that movie shows have greater content. TV-MA, which stands for "Mature Audience," is the most frequently used classification for movie and tv shows, followed by TV-14, which stands for "Younger Audience." Since the number of movie shows is higher than the number of TV shows, movie shows receive the highest rating when compared to TV shows, from this we can say people like to watch movie show than compare to tv shows.

Over the years, Netflix has added more shows to its platform. Most movies were released in 2017 and 2018. Most television shows were broadcast in 2019 and 2020. The covid-19-induced lockdowns that stopped the production of shows may be to blame for the decline in the number of movies added in the year 2020. There are fewer movies uploaded this year because the Netflix data we have only extends through 2021.

Netflix's movie show library is expanding much more quickly than its TV show library. It looks that Netflix has prioritised adding more movie material over TV shows. The growth of movies has been significantly more pronounced than that of TV shows.More content is released over the Christmas season (October, November, December, and January). There are more movies released each month compared to TV shows.Documentaries are the most popular Netflix category, followed by stand-up comedy, dramas, and foreign films. Kids TV is the most well-liked Netflix TV shows.

The majority of movies durations last between 90 and 120 minutes. Most tv shows have just one season. The lengthiest average runtimes are found in NC-17 rated movies. The average duration of movies with a TV-Y rating is the shortest. The geograph visualisations show that the United States and India are the two countries that produce the most content.

The director, cast, country, genre, and description are chosen as the attributes to cluster the data based on. These attributes' values underwent tokenization, preprocessing, and vectorization using TFIDF vectorizer. A total of 20000 characteristics were produced through TFIDF vectorization. For the purpose of overcoming the dimensionality curse, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 4000 components were able to capture more than 80% of variance.

The ideal number of clusters was found to be six when we first created clusters using the k-means clustering technique. The elbow method and Silhouette score analysis were used to get this result.The Agglomerative clustering technique was then used to create clusters, with 12 being the optimum number. The dendrogram was visualised to achieve this.The similarity matrix acquired after utilising cosine similarity was used to construct a content-based recommender system. Based on the sort of show the user viewed, this recommender system will provide them with 10 recommendations.
